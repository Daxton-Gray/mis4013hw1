        <strong>Chet Holmgren.</strong> After some luck in the draft lottery, the Thunder's first draft selection was the 2nd overall pick in the draft. With this pick, the thunder took arguably the best player in the draft, Center Chet Holmgren. Although he was injured his first year in the league, Chet showed why he was a top choice in the draft the following season by playing as a top center in the league without missing a single game.

        <strong>Ousmane Dieng</strong> The Thunder have notoriously held the most draft capital in league history after beginning a rebuild in the summer of 2019. In this draft, GM Sam Presti decided to trade 3 future first round picks to the New York Knicks to acquire the 11th overall pick in the draft. With this pick, he took a gamble on athletic talent, Ousmane Dieng. He has been developing on the bottom of the roster and in the NBA G-League, but has shown some bright flashes of would his talent could lead to in the future.

        <strong>Jalen Williams</strong> The Thunder have a strong history of drafting well at the 12th pick and they continued that in 2022. At the 12th selection, the Thunder selected arguably the best player in the draft, Jalen Williams. He immediately became a top player on the team and is rapidly turning into one of the best players in the league at nearly every position on the court.

        <strong>Jaylin Williams</strong> The Thunder decided to double up on guys with this name in the 2022 draft when they selected Jaylin Williams with the fourth pick in the second round. This funny coincidence ended up paying off as he has quickly become a crucial part of the team as a physical big man that can also pass and shoot with great skill.
