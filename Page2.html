        <strong>This was Green Bay's first Super Bowl.</strong> Following the merge of the NFL and the AFL, 9x NFL Champion Green Bay Packers won the first ever Super Bowl. The Packers were coached by Super Bowl trophy namesake, Vince Lombardi and led by Hall of Fame Quarterback Bart Starr. They defeated the AFL's Kansas City Chiefs 35-10 to take home the first Super Bowl trophy.

Starr and the Packers dominated the league for another year to make their return to the Super Bowl in 1968. This time around, they defeated the AFL's Oakland Raiders 33-14 to bring home the second ever Super Bowl trophy.

        <strong>This was Green Bay's third Super Bowl.</strong> After being dormant for about 30 years, the Packers returned to power. Hall of Fame Quarterback Brett Favre helped restore the team to it's former glory by winning Super Bowl XXXI and taking them to Super Bowl XXXII as well. Favre led the packers to a 35-21 victory over the future NFL dynasty New England Patriots.

        <strong>This was Green Bay's fourth Super Bowl.</strong> As Favre was nearing the end of his career, but still in his prime, Green Bay decided to take a shot at a talented quarterback out of Cal named Aaron Rodgers. This new quarterback would become a second straight Hall of Fame Quarterback for the franchise. Although he didn't see the field for a few years, he was quick to lead his packers to a Super Bowl. In Super Bowl XLV, Rodgers' underdog Packers defeated NFL powerhouse Pittsburg Steelers 31-25 for the teams fourth Lombardi Trophy.
